## Avirs-Final-Year-Project
</br>

This repo contains code for my final years project, Automated Vehicle Identification and Recognition system <b>(AVIRS)</b>

The idea of this project is to identify vehicles of interest based on their registration number and also keep log of every vehicle for future reference.
